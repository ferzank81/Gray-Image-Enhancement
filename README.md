# Gray-Image-Enhancement

It is called the Regional Similarity Transfer Function (RSTF) that considers the density distribution similarity between adjoining pixels.

This study proposes a transformation function based on the similarity of the distribution of intensity between adjoining pixels and the maximum grey level from the histogram curve. The maximum grey level value is labelled Max, and the contrast increases as pixels to the left approach a 0 value while pixels to the right approach a value of 255. In addition, contrast and brightness increase positively according to the degree of similarity of intensity distribution between adjoining pixels.
